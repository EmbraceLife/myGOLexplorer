# myGOLexplorer

my version is built upon [a processing demo](https://processing.org/examples/gameoflife.html) created by Joan Soler-Adillon. 

**Note**: master branch is obsolete, and the latest branch is most updated version.

1. spacebar: to iterate or pause
2. r : to reset randomize environment for grid
3. c : to clean up grid

**New features developed below** -- 
* `n` : iterate step by step or spacebar to iterate repeatedly
* press `1`, `2`, `3`: set iteration speed from every 10millis to 50millis to 100millis
* `z` : hold `z`, moving mouse, to select zooming area
* `x`, `e`: press `x`, then press `z` to zoom in
* click to change cell's death/life
* `s`, `e`: press `s` and then `e`, to save changes into previous grid
* `q`,`a`,`w`,`p`: in zoom mode, press `q`, hold `a`, move mouse to select, press `w` , to capture a creature, then `p` to save it
* `l`, `v`, `m`: press `l` to load creature, hold `v` move mouse to find a position, `m` to release creature
