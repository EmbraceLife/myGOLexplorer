# myGOLexplorer

my version is built upon [a processing demo](https://processing.org/examples/gameoflife.html) created by Joan Soler-Adillon. 

**Note**: master branch is obsolete, and the latest branch is most updated version.

1. spacebar: to iterate or pause
2. r : to reset randomize environment for grid
3. c : to clean up grid

**New features developed below** -- 
4. n : iterate step by step or spacebar to iterate repeatedly
5. press 1, 2, 3: set iteration speed from every 10millis to 50millis to 100millis
6. z : hold 'z', moving mouse, to select zooming area
7. x, e: press x, then press z to zoom in
8. click to change cell's death/life
9. s, e: press s and then e, to save changes into previous grid
10. q,a,w,p: in zoom mode, press q, hold a, move mouse to select, press w , to capture a creature, then p to save it
