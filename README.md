# myGOLexplorer

myGOLexplorer project is intended to be a multi-features playground for game of life. Currently it still has a long way to go...

myGOLexplorer is built upon [a processing demo](https://processing.org/examples/gameoflife.html) created by Joan Soler-Adillon. 

**Note**: master branch is obsolete, check the latest branch for updated version.
